        <p>Welcome to SRIT
This Society was established by Founder-cum-Secretary <b>Sri Aluru Sambasiva Reddy</b> in November 2007 in memory of his mother, Late Smt. Aluru Narayanamma, to give shape to his firm belief that “EDUCATION IS A KEY ENABLER FOR PROGRESS”. This belief has shaped his entire life – he himself excelled in his scholastic years and then became a tutor, teaching students not only his subject but also imparting higher human values. As his career progressed, he wanted to ensure that maximum students from rural and developing areas could derive benefit from this credo.
